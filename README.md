# Apply CNN to gait recognition based on inertial signals  
In the research, I collected tri-axial acceleration and angular velocity and processed tri-axial data through
filtering, smoothing, normalization and feature extraction; then constructed multi-channel convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) for classification.  
Experiments tested the influence of processing methods, different splicing ways, various channel models
on the classification ability, and the accuracy of the optimal model on out-of-sample test reached 93.4%,
indicating that CNN model can well identify gait characteristics based on inertial signals.
